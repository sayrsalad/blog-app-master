## ALCOHOL BLOG POST WEB APPLICATION

The researchers believe that developing a web application that focuses solely on alcohol or cocktail drinks is a good idea. The researchers think this is a good opportunity to create a blog post with the use of three APIs. The researchers will use the following API: TheCocktailDB, MonkeyLearn Text Analysis, Google Map API. TheCocktailDB API will be
used as the main heart of the application because all of the post created by the user is based upon the cocktail item that is from TheCocktailDb API.

The MonkeyLearn Text Analysis will be used by the researchers to analyze the post and comments and determine whether it’s positive, neutral, or negative and the Google Map API can be used so that the user can find an alcohol place that is near to the user’s location.
